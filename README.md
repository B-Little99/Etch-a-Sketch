This project is creating an Etch-a-Sketch online to utilise my DOM knowledge and continue applying my knowledge to projects.

What I learnt during this project: 

    Using DOM features such as createElement and appendChild to create the canvass using a loop on loading the page.

    Using 'this' to set the colour of the tile that I was hovered on.

    I used template literals to add in the random red, blue and green colours to the RGB format string.

    Using JavaScript to adjust/change CSS. I used JavaScript to apply a random background colour to each tile.
